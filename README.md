## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TJ-Liebsch/gemini-explorer.git
   cd gemini-explorer

## Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Python projects. This keeps your project dependencies isolated. If you have `virtualenv` installed, create a new environment with:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies
Inside the virtual environment, install all necessary dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting the FastAPI Server

After the installation, you can start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn. Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash

```

## Accessing the API
With the server running, you can access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000.`

For interactive API documentation, visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`, where you can test the API endpoints directly from your browser.
